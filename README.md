# 📚 Virtual Library — C++ Project

## 🎯 Project Description
This project is a **Virtual Library Management Application** written in **C++**.  
It allows users to manage information about different types of media items — such as books, magazines, audio CDs, CD-ROMs, cassettes, videocassettes, and more.

Each media record includes:
- Type (book, magazine, etc.)
- Author
- Title
- Year of publication
- Availability status (free / occupied)

The application provides full functionality for adding, viewing, and searching media, as well as saving and loading data from files.

## ✅ Functional Requirements (per assignment)

### 1. Data Management (10 points)
- The program should allow entering an arbitrary number of different media items.
- Each item should include its details (type, author, title, year, status).

### 2. Search Functionality (10 points)
- The program should support searching for **available** and **occupied** media items.

### 3. Object-Oriented Design (30 points)
- At least **3 classes** must be implemented.
- All class details must be **encapsulated** (use of `private` variables).
- Classes must include:
  - **At least two constructors**
  - **Public getters and setters** for private variables

### 4. Input Validation (10 points)
- User input must be validated (e.g. check for valid year, non-empty strings, etc.).

### 5. Operator Overloading (10 points)
- The `<<` operator must be overloaded for easy data display.

### 6. File Operations (20 points)
- Media data must be saved to and read from a **file**.

### 7. UML Class Diagram (10 points)
- The project must include a UML diagram describing the class structure.
